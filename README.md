**Why are your business card a program?**

My career as a programmer began during the early 80â€™s at dawn of computer typesetting. Electronic Typesetting was radically new stuff. I started working with TeX and postscript. I was developing C programs to write both TeX and postscript. The idea was to take unformatted
text and typeset it.
To make my business cards I just designed them with postscript. At the
time I did not have access to bitmapped displays nor any graphic art
software. My scripts ran on a headless Sun 3/160 and were output to an Apple LaserWriter. I modified the Berkeley LPR (line printer software) to log
postscript error messages from the Apple LaserWriter. Reading the printer
logs was the only way to debug Postscript programs. Eventually, Ghostscript and bitmapped
displays came along making all of these little programs obsolete.
